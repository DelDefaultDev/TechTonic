Folder for things that are broken and I can't figure out how to fix.
Basically just a place for big issues that I can't really figure out just yet, like game crashing.
Known issues will be listed here and broken files will be in this folder.
Help in fixing these is appreciated.

CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:
Interspatial Melter keeps crashing Mindustry when being placed
Interspatial Separator crashes Mindustry when trying to look at its info both through Core Database and the in-game block selector
