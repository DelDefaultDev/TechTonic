# TechTonic
TechTonic is an in-development mod for Mindustry.

As V6 is going to be a stable build soon, according to its repository, TechTonic will start being ported to V6. When this happens, the mod's repository will have two main folders, one for each version. The V5 folder will be an archive of sorts for the V5 content, and the V6 folder will contain both ported and new content. When downloading the mod, be sure to download the right version, otherwise the mod will likely not be loaded.

"Broken folder" content for V5 might stay unfixed as I won't be trying as much to fix older content.
