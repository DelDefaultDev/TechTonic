# TechTonic
TechTonic is an in-development mod for Mindustry.

The repository has a folder for each major version of the game, starting from V5. New folders will be added upon each new stable build release once guides are added for porting content to the new version.

When downloading the mod, import the version that corresponds to the stable build version you want to play the mod on.

Old broken content will stay behind; other people are free to try fixing the content but I won't be trying as working on the newer content will be my priority instead.
